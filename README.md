# Project Overview
## Database Setup
The project begins with the design of a well-structured database schema to store movie and user data securely.
## Back-end Development
* The server-side code (asp.net web api) is developed to handle HTTP requests efficiently.
* CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are implemented for movies and user management.
* User Authentication
* A robust and secure user registration and login system is developed.
* Advanced features like password hashing and session management enhance security.
## Front-end Development
The user interface is designed using angular to be visually appealing, and user-friendly.
## Role-Based Authorization
Role-based authorization ensures that different users have appropriate access levels and permissions, for example: An admin can add or edit a movie but a viewer can't.
